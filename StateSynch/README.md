# In this tutorial, we will be setting up StateSynch.
- StateSynch - helps to synchronize almost from the last block through the distributor node. This helps to synchronize the node almost immediately after it is launched.
- To run StateSynch, we need two servers. On the first server `distributing` we will keep a constantly working and synchronized node. On the second server `Consumer` we will run a fresh node and synchronize it using StateSynch.
- **Please Note** - StateSynch may **NOT** always start immediately. This is her main drawback. This depends on the number of peers that have connected and synchronized from the "Distributor" node. Sometimes projects don't support StateSynch.

## 1. Configuration of `config.toml` and `app.toml` on `distributing` server
In the Ð¡OSMOS project, after the initiation of the node by comand `cosmos init`, will be created `.cosmos` folder. Inside this folder located all related info about your node and validator.

Input your value instead `<.comsos>` and delete `<>`
- Example `FOLDER=.nibid`
```
FOLDER=<.cosmos>
sed -i.bak -e "s%^laddr = \"tcp://127.0.0.1:26657\"%laddr = \"tcp://0.0.0.0:26657\"%" $HOME/$FOLDER/config/config.toml
sed -i.bak -e "s/^pruning *=.*/pruning = \"custom\"/" $HOME/$FOLDER/config/app.toml
sed -i.bak -e "s/^pruning-interval *=.*/pruning-interval = \"17\"/" $HOME/$FOLDER/config/app.toml
sed -i.bak -e "s/^pruning-keep-every *=.*/pruning-keep-every = \"2000\"/" $HOME/$FOLDER/config/app.toml
sed -i.bak -e "s/^snapshot-interval *=.*/snapshot-interval = \"2000\"/" $HOME/$FOLDER/config/app.toml
sed -i.bak -e "s/^snapshot-keep-recent *=.*/snapshot-keep-recent = \"5\"/" $HOME/$FOLDER/config/app.toml
```

## 2. Pull out your ID and IP
Change `<cosmos>` on your binary name and delete `<>`
- Example `echo -e "$(nibid tendermint sh...`
```
echo -e "$(<cosmos> tendermint show-node-id)@$(curl -s ifconfig.me)$(grep -A 3 "\[p2p\]" ~/$FOLDER/config/config.toml | egrep -o ":[0-9]+")"
```
The out put should be something like:
`8dd57aaef961d9943d5d7f0fcae6683c331065a3@81.34.157.35:26656`

## 3. Check your IP

Restart your node than do:
```
echo http://$(wget -qO- eth0.me):26657/
```
You should receve `http://81.34.157.35:26657/` and then try to open it in your browser.
